## MappingSyntheticLethals

Code used to map synthetic lethals from metabolic models of clinically relevant pathogens (_S. aureus_, _K. pneumoniae_ etc.) using the Fast-SL algorithm (https://github.com/RamanLab/FastSL). 

Research part of my undergraduate thesis, carried out under Dr Karthik Raman at the Computational Systems Biology Lab, IIT-Madras. Collaborated with Senthamizhan V.

## Project goal

To identify novel regulatory and interaction networks between identified synthetic lethals in pathogens by constructing interaction networks and surveying relevant literature. Single, double and triple lethals were identified using modes in the Fast-SL code. 

## Data used

Metabolic models obtained from the CASTLE database (https://github.com/RamanLab/CASTLE).
