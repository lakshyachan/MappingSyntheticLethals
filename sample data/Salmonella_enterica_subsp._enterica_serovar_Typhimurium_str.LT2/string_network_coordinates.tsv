Probably acts as an electrical shunt for an outwardly-directed proton pump that is linked to amino acid decarboxylation, as part of the extreme acid resistance (XAR) response.

ydiB	99287.STM1359	0.36194772868699443	0.7533846153846154	rgb(117,117,239)	Quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase; The actual biological function of YdiB remains unclear, nor is it known whether 3-dehydroshikimate or quinate represents the natural substrate. Catalyzes the reversible NAD-dependent reduction of both 3-dehydroshikimate (DHSA) and 3-dehydroquinate to yield shikimate (SA) and quinate, respectively. It can use both NAD or NADP for catalysis, however it has higher catalytic efficiency with NAD.

Catalyzes specifically the phosphorylation on 2'-hydroxyl of the adenosine moiety of NAD to yield NADP. It can use ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates as a source of phosphorus. NADH cannot replace NAD as a substrate.
